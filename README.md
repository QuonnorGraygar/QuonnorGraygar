#### Connor "Quonnor" Gregor: Math Researcher by Day, Math Enthusiast by Night

- Hello to all visiting this page! As suggested, I am Connor Gregor: a post-doctoral researcher at McMaster University who has an interest in machine learning research as a a means to improve math pedagogy.
- I graduated with my doctorate in applied mathematics from the University of Guelph where I spent a large portion of my time learning how to encode heuristic evolutionary algorithms in C++.
- I am an avid enjoyer of tabletop games, baking bread products, and books that are thicker than your wrist.
- If you ever need to reach me, do so at gregoc9@mcmaster.ca: the e-mail address for my work.
